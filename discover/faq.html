<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What happens after I register?</strong>
<br><br>A: We will be in contact with you after the registration deadline with more logistical information such as session placement and classroom location. There is a high probability that your daughter will be placed in her first session choice; thus, once you register, mark your calendar!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: If it is after the registration deadline, and I would still like to register, what should I do?</strong>
<br><br>A: Please complete the registration form, and then send email to <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> so that we can immediately find placement for your daughter.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What is the course content?</strong>
<br><br>A: <strong>Course content changes with each semester.</strong> Every three years or so (with a brand new set of participants), we repeat activities that the girls really enjoyed, and replace the ones that were just "ok." This means that if your daughter attends the program for 4 years (3rd - 6th grade), she will not repeat activities her full 4-year attendance. Following is a list of typical topics and activities included in our program.
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Grades 3/4:
<ul>
<li>civil engineering (girls work for Three Little Pigs Construction Company) and try to build a house that can't be blown down</li>
<li>computer science (girls learn about a piece of paper that is more intelligent than everyone in the room)</li>
<li>mechanical engineering (demos and time to engage with robotics and electronics)</li>
<li>chemistry (chemistry magic show performed by Mines Chemistry professor)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Grades 5/6:
<ul>
<li>engineering design (where girls create a design of a device, and then implement someone else's design)</li>
<li>biomedical engineering (where girls build a prosthetic leg)</li>
<li>physics (where girls learn about astronomy and space)</li>
<li>geology (where girls learn about rocks and processes)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Q: Am I allowed to sit in on the classes?</strong>

Send email to <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a>  to request a make-up day. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: If I know ahead of time that my daughter will miss a day, should I let someone know?</strong>
<br><br>A: If you are able to do a make-up on another day that week, then email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> and request a make-up day. (See previous question/answer for more details.)</p> 

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Can my daughter be placed with her friend from school?</strong>
<br><br>A: We make every effort to honor these requests.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Who are the DISCOVER TECH teachers and how are they chosen?</strong>
<br><br>A: All DISCOVER TECH teachers are current Mines female students who love engaging the next generation in science and engineering projects. They are chosen through an application/interview process, and then hired after a background check is done. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What is the teacher/child ratio?</strong>
<br><br>A: Each class will have either up to 15 students (with 2 teachers) or up to 20 students (with 3 teachers). </p>

<p><strong>Q: My daughter has medical issues. Can she still participate?</strong> 
<br><br>A: Please email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> with details. We are happy to work with you and make appropriate accommodations. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: How will I be notified if a class is cancelled due to weather?</strong>

<p><strong>Q: When are the program t-shirts distributed?</strong>
<br><br>A: One participant t-shirt is included in the program fee and will be distributed the first day of class.
