wondering if it's better for you if I send text for all pages,
	or if you transfer over what is there already, and I send you updates?

--> Wondering about the links in the top right of the internal pages - I was
	thinking text similar to the home page in each of them (Discover, Explore,
	Create, etc.) - what do you think, and should I create images for you? Or do
	you want to handle this?
