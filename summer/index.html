        Many families have contacted us regarding the status of Summer 2021 camps. Due to the changing COVID-19 response and pending Mines directives, we are uncertain as to the model (limited virtual or in-person offerings) our summer camps will be held. As a result, there will be a delay in the launching of online camp registrations. If you would like to be kept informed about summer camps for boys and girls, please complete the short form

         Python for Data Science is for participants who have worked with Python before, and understand the basic concepts, but otherwise don’t need to be advanced -- just the next level from beginners.
        What is the most popular movie of all time? Are more expensive restaurants really better? What is attracting students to one school over another? The process of learning from data is called Data Science, which is used to answer questions like these. Campers will form their own questions about the world around them, learn to analyze data using different methods, and then learn how to use Python programming to better understand what the data might be telling them!

        CS@Mines students will lead small group Zoom lessons each morning. Each afternoon, campers can apply their knowledge by working through self-guided activities and projects -- calling on their instructors during ‘office hours’ in Zoom for help.

    </p>
    <p>
        Have you ever wondered how things are embedded with sensors, software and other technologies – that can be controlled with a phone? How does a “smart home” work? Participants will gain an understanding of sensor systems, by learning about and forming connections between software and hardware using an Arduino - a physical programmable circuit board!  They will learn the foundations of connecting a microprocessor to buttons, LEDs, motors, speakers, GPS units, cameras, the internet, and even your smart-phone or your TV. Participants will use their creativity to develop their own creations, and these foundations will help your child better understand robotics concepts and general entrepreneurship in the tech world!

    <p>Each day, camp participants will connect with each other and CS@Mines student leaders in small groups (e.g., 10 participants in group) over Zoom. On Zoom we will learn about and discuss various STEM fields. We will discover careers we've never heard of, as well as important issues and innovations that are currently affecting our world. Participants will realize all sorts of career opportunities exist! Have you considered the possibilities?</p>
