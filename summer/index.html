		<i style="font-size: 1.2em;">Don't just buy a new video game, make one. Don't just download the latest app, help design it. Don't just play on your phone, program it. No one is born a computer scientist, but with a little hard work and some math and science, just about anyone can become one.</i>

	<h4>Time: 9:00am - 3:30pm</h4>
	<p>
	Do you want to learn how to create a video game? Do you want to develop your own stories or animations and share with others around the world? Do you want to make a robot move and tell it how to interact with our world? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this is the summer camp for you!
	</p><p>
	Students will be introduced to computer programming by designing an interactive visual application and interfacing with the Finch robot. This course will use Greenfoot (for those with some prior coding experience) and Scratch (for those without); Greenfoot is a visual Java-based environment, while Scratch is a visual drag-n-drop environment.
	</p><p>
	NOTE: The boys and girls sessions will come together for breaks in the computer lab, including physical breaks (e.g., kick ball) and mental/kinesthetic breaks (e.g., CS Unplugged activities that teach CS fundamentals without using a computer). 
	</p><p>
	<strong>Cost: $400*</strong><br>
	Cost includes lunch in campus dining hall<br>
	*Need-based scholarships available. Please email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> to request financial assistance.
	</p>
	<p>
	At least five students must enroll for each session to occur. Each session will have a maximum of 16 students (2 teachers).
