                Studies show that girls' interest in science/engineering subjects starts to decline the closer the girls get to middle school. As a result, far fewer women pursue careers in the various STEM fields than their male counterparts.</p>
		<p class="right">
                In response to this information, in the Fall of 2012, Dr. Tracy Camp and her female Computer Science students created a program targeting the 3rd-6th grade age group. This program is designed to foster and continue girls' interest in the STEM subjects through creative and interactive activities. The program is very popular with local elementary students, and has grown to include middle and high school aged girls.</p>
