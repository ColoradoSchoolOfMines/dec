                <h2>For High School Girls</h2>

                <p>Mentoring and role modeling are important ways to have an impact on high school students. Therefore, for our 2019-20 academic year, DECtech and the Computer Science Department at Mines are partnering with local high school teachers to help foster and maintain female and underrepresented student interest in CS. Our Mines students are excited about the opportunity to assist in Computer Science classrooms!
                </p>        
                <p>                
                If you are a Computer Science teacher with interest in having a CS@Mines female and/or underrepresented student involved in your course this year, click here 
                <a href = "https://forms.gle/bAML2u184595CasD6" target = "blank">here</a> 
                to complete the interest form. We will get in touch with you to discuss your specific needs and to schedule our student involvement in your class.
                </p>

                <p>DECtech is also involved with high school female coding and technology clubs by providing mentorship and instruction. If you are involved with an after school club that is interested in Mines involvement, send email to

                <h2>
                    New Internship Opportunity for DECtech Alumni
                </h2>
                <p>
                Beginning with the Spring 2020 session of DECtech, young women who have participated in at least two DECtech sessions are welcome to apply for an internship with our program. This internship experience is for the duration of each session and provides an opportunity for the high school student to both continue her interest in the STEM fields and mentor younger girls.
                <br> <br> 
                More details about this opportunity and information on how to apply coming soon!

                    <h2>Our CREATE Tech High School Student Assistants</h2>

                    <p><img src="../images/instructors/alex.png" class="instructor-photo" alt="Photo of Alex"><strong>Alex</strong>  is a Senior studying Computer Science at Mines. She has experience in graphic design, web design, and mobile application design. Her passion for cultivating diversity has led her to study and work abroad in Europe, lead outreach events in her community, and work as a teaching assistant on the Mines campus. In addition to DECTech, she works part-time at Woot Math, a 6-year old tech company from Boulder that has an online platform to help math teachers close the gap in the classroom. Alex loves this job because of her passion for education and helping others through technology. At DECTech, she currently helps with our off-campus outreach and special events. <br><br>

                    <p><img src="../images/instructors/amira.jpg" class="instructor-photo" alt="Photo of Alex"><strong>Amira</strong> is a junior in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. She was born in Chile and moved to Lakewood, Colorado, when she was 9 years-old. In her free time she enjoys experimenting with all sorts of art mediums, from drawing to photography to face painting, as well as video games, soccer, archery, and more. Despite having a variety of different interests she decided to study Computer Science because of how applicable the field is. She was an instructor for DECtech summer camps the summer of 2019 and is currently working her second semester as a teaching assistant for DECtech. She wishes to apply technology in areas which lack or could benefit from it, for instance, mental health. She wants to not only watch as innovative solutions are developed but hopefully create those developments herself while encouraging others to do the same.<br><br>


                    <p><img src="../images/instructors/grace.jpeg" class="instructor-photo" alt="Photo of Alex"><strong>Grace</strong> is a sophomore at Mines studying general CS right now but thinking about taking the CS + Data Science track. This semester she is a TA/mentor for the CSCI101 and 102 classes, which are an intro to CS using Python. She is also working with DECtech as a TA for the mobile app development class using block code. She is most familiar with Python and C++, although she worked over the summer with JavaScript using React to make a mobile website. She got into CS a few years ago through Girls Who Code, and has found that she really likes being in the classroom and helping other people learn about CS. Grace is from Austin, and really loves backpacking and being outdoors!<br><br>
