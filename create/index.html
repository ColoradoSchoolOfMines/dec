                <h2>For 10th - 12th Grade Girls</h2>

                <p>Mentoring and role modeling are important ways to have an impact on high school students. Therefore, for our 2019-20 academic year, DECtech and the Computer Science Department at Mines are partnering with local high school teachers to help foster and maintain female and underrepresented student interest in CS. Our Mines students are excited about the opportunity to assist in Computer Science classrooms!
                </p>        
                <p>                
                If you are a Computer Science teacher with interest in having a CS@Mines female and/or underrepresented student involved in your course this year, click here 
                <a href = "https://forms.gle/bAML2u184595CasD6" target = "blank">here</a> 
 to complete the interest form. We will get in touch with you to discuss your specific needs and to schedule our student involvement in your class.
                </p>
                
                <p>DECtech is also involved with high school female coding and technology clubs by providing mentorship and instruction. If you are involved with an after school club that is interested in Mines involvement, send email to

                    New Internship Opportunity for DECtech Alumni
                </h2>
                <p>
                Beginning with the Spring 2020 session of DECtech, young women who have participated in at least two DECtech sessions are welcome to apply for an internship with our program. This internship experience is for the duration of each session and provides an opportunity for the high school student to both continue her interest in the STEM fields and mentor younger girls.
                <br> <br> 
                More details about this opportunity and information on how to apply coming soon!
