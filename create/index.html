                <h2>For High School Girls</h2>

                <p>Mentoring and role modeling are important ways to have an impact on high school students. Therefore, DECtech and the Computer Science Department at Mines are partnering with local high school teachers to help foster and maintain female and underrepresented student interest in CS. Our Mines students are excited about the opportunity to assist in Computer Science classrooms!
                </p>
                <p>
                If you are a Computer Science teacher with interest in having a CS@Mines female and/or underrepresented student involved in your course this year, click here
                <a href = "https://forms.gle/bAML2u184595CasD6" target = "blank">here</a>
                to complete the interest form. We will get in touch with you to discuss your specific needs and to schedule our student involvement in your class.
                </p>

                <p>DECtech is also involved with high school female coding and technology clubs by providing mentorship and instruction. If you are involved with an after school club that is interested in Mines involvement, send email to
                <a href = "mailto: stem-tech@mines.edu" target="blank"> stem-tech@mines.edu</a>.

                <h2>
                    Internship Opportunity for DECtech Alumni
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Young women who have participated in at least two DECtech sessions are welcome to apply for an internship with our program. This internship experience is for the duration of each session and provides an opportunity for the high school student to both continue her interest in the STEM fields and mentor younger girls.

                    The DECtech High School Internship Program began in Spring 2020. We accept applications for each semester (including summer). Email 
                    <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> 
                    with interest and we will get back to you with next steps.

                    <h2>Our CREATE Tech High School Student Assistant</h2>

                    <p><img src="../images/instructors/amira.jpg" class="instructor-photo" ><strong>Amira</strong> is a senior in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. She was born in Chile and moved to Lakewood, Colorado, when she was 9 years-old. In her free time she enjoys experimenting with all sorts of art mediums, from drawing to photography to face painting, as well as video games, soccer, archery, and more. Despite having a variety of different interests outside Computer Science she decided to study it because of how applicable the field is. She was an instructor for DECtech summer camps the summer of 2019 and is currently working her third semester as a teaching assistant and high school Computer Science classroom assistant for DECtech. She wishes to apply technology in areas which lack or could benefit from it, for instance, mental health or the arts. She wants to not only watch as innovative solutions are developed but hopefully create those developments herself while encouraging others to do the same.<br><br>
