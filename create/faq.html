<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What happens after I register?</strong>
<br><br>A: We will be in contact with you after the registration deadline with more logistical information such as session placement and classroom location. There is a high probability that your daughter will be placed in her first session choice; thus, once you register, mark your calendar!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: If it is after the registration deadline, and I would still like to register, what should I do?</strong>
<br><br>A: Please complete the registration form, and then send email to <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> so that we can immediately find placement for your daughter.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What is the course content?</strong>
<br><br>A: <strong>Course content changes with each semester.</strong> Every three years or so (with a brand new set of participants), we repeat activities that the girls really enjoyed, and replace the ones that were just "ok." This means that if your daughter attends the program for 4 years (3rd - 6th grade), she will not repeat activities her full 4-year attendance. Following is a list of typical topics and activities included in our program.
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Grades 3/4:
<ul>
<li>civil engineering (girls work for Three Little Pigs Construction Company) and try to build a house that can't be blown down</li>
<li>computer science (girls learn about a piece of paper that is more intelligent than everyone in the room)</li>
<li>mechanical engineering (demos and time to engage with robotics and electronics)</li>
<li>chemistry (chemistry magic show performed by Mines Chemistry professor)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Grades 5/6:
<ul>
<li>engineering design (where girls create a design of a device, and then implement someone else's design)</li>
<li>biomedical engineering (where girls build a prosthetic leg)</li>
<li>physics (where girls learn about astronomy and space)</li>
<li>geology (where girls learn about rocks and processes)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Q: How do I pay for camp?</strong>
<br><br>A: The preferred method of payment is by credit card. After you submit your registration form, you will be prompted to visit this site to complete payment: <a href="https://stemtech.csmspace.com/" target="_blank">https://stemtech.csmspace.com</a>. You may also visit this website at any time prior to the start of the program to complete your payment.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What if the t-shirt size I requested doesn't fit my daughter?</strong>
<br><br>A: The size you request on the registration form helps us with the ordering process. When you arrive at camp, you may compare and purchase the appropriate size for your daughter.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: How do I drop off/pick up my daughter?</strong>
<br><br>A: Directions to Mines campus are available <a href="https://www.mines.edu/MapsDirectionsParkingInfo" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<br>A map of the campus is <a href="https://inside.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/facilities/MinesCampusMap.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>Brown is #10 on the map (at the Maple and 17th Street intersection). You will drop off (and pick-up) your daughter near Brown Building. 
The drop off area will be across from where Maple meets 17th, at the curb painted red. See these maps for an illustration.

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Am I allowed to sit in on the classes?</strong>
<br><br>A: Often the rooms we use will not have space for parents to sit in. If you feel sitting in would help your daughter be more comfortable, then email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> and we will try to make arrangements. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What if my daughter is sick and misses a class?</strong>
<br><br>A: We cover the same content in different sessions all week; if space exists, your daughter is welcome to do a make-up class that week (e.g., normally she attends on Tuesdays, but will attend on Wednesday this week). Send email to <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a>  to request a make-up day. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: If I know ahead of time that my daughter will miss a day, should I let someone know?</strong>
<br><br>A: If you are able to do a make-up on another day that week, then email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> and request a make-up day. (See previous question/answer for more details.)</p> 

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Can my daughter be placed with her friend from school?</strong>
<br><br>A: We make every effort to honor these requests.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What is the teacher/child ratio?</strong>
<br><br>A: Each class will have either up to 15 students (with 2 teachers) or up to 20 students (with 3 teachers). </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: My daughter has medical issues. Can she still participate?</strong> 
<br><br>A: Please email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> with details. We are happy to work with you and make appropriate accommodations. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: How will I be notified if a class is cancelled due to weather?</strong>
<br><br>A: As long as Mines does not cancel class, the class will not be canceled. If Mines closes, email will be sent to all parents.</p> 

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: I answered "yes" for a program t-shirt. When do I receive it and how do I pay for it?</strong>
<br><br>A: Include your t-shirt payment ($10.75 including sales tax/shirt) with program payment ($50) via credit card at this website: <a href="https://stemtech.csmspace.com/" target="_blank">https://stemtech.csmspace.com</a>. We place the order for t-shirts once registration is closed, and will distribute after one of our program meetings. We will have a few extras on hand for those who change their minds, or need a different size than the one ordered.</p>
