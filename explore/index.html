                        Hello, I'm <strong>Grace!</strong> I'm originally from Austin, and in my free time you can find me backpacking, reading, or hopefully swimming in a lake. I'm a junior, and this is my third semester working with DECtech. I'm a Computer Science major, and I love teaching and being around kids. I've previously helped with a Robotics course and an app development course for DECtech. I also helped with a ton of virtual STEM camps we held over the summer!<br><br>
