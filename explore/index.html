	<h3>2018 Fall Session</h3>
	<h4>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER Chemistry or Virtual Reality, or BOTH!</h4>

	<hr>
	<h3>Chemistry </h3>
	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Chemistry and Biochemistry in Everyday Life</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong>Have you ever wondered why medicine makes us feel better, how glow sticks emit light, or why cakes expand in the oven? We can answer all these questions with chemistry! Chemistry gives us the tools to understand how the world works - meaning we use it every day! In this program, we will study the basics of chemical reactions, crystal structures, acids & bases, and more. Participants will also engage in various hands-on activities to explore the applications of chemistry and biochemistry in fields like medicine and forensic science. By the end of the session, girls will have a better understanding of the amazing science we experience every day and how we can apply our knowledge to make the world a better place.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<strong>Chemistry and Biochemistry session days/dates (choose ONE session):</strong>
	<li>MONDAY session: September 10, September 24, October 8, November 5</li>
	<li>WEDNESDAY session: September 12, September 26, October 10, November 7</li>
</ul>

	<h3>Virtual Reality</h3>

	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Virtual Reality in the Engineering World</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong>The wall between technology and reality is slowly fading away with developments in virtual reality technology. Virtual reality, or VR, is an immersive 3d world created by computers. VR is becoming mainstream in the video game industry to create exciting and inventive experiences. However, VR is not limited to entertainment and video games! VR can be used in modern medicine, training systems for aircraft pilots, technology prototyping, and many other industries. In this class, we will be exploring a VR lab on the Mines campus run by Dr. Sebnem Duzgun. This lab is an interactive mine used to train mining engineers and develop new mining technologies. Students will get the opportunity to tour the VR mine, then contribute to it themselves by creating 3d modeled hard hats. By the end of the class, students will be able to view their 3d hard hats in a VR environment!</p>
