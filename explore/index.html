		<i style="font-size: 1.2em;">Don't just buy a new video game, make one. Don't just download the latest app, help design it. Don't just play on your phone, program it. No one is born a computer scientist, but with a little hard work and some math and science, just about anyone can become one.</i>

	<p>This research project explores computer science (CS) fundamentals through fun games and kinesthetic activities (without using a computer).
	With lots of physical movement and fun, attendees will learn basic computer science concepts (e.g.
	algorithms, binary numbers and data compression), as well as how these concepts fit into computing
	careers. This curriculum gives attendees a foundation to delve deeper into computer science or
	engineering, if they wish, or just show them that they can learn technical concepts (even if they don't think of themselves as capable or expect to pursue a formal career in computing).</p>

	<p>Participants choose ONE session of 8 classes (either Tuesday or Wednesday):</p>
