	<h3>2019 Spring Session</h3>
	<h4>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER Computer Science or Physics, or BOTH!</h4>

	<hr>
	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Virtual Reality Programming with A-Frame</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Virtual Reality is a rapidly growing technology with applications in many different fields. This spring, we will introduce participants to the basics of building virtual reality worlds using HTML and the A-Frame JavaScript Library. Participants will choose the virtual experience they would like to create, and throughout our time together we will learn how to code our worlds and make our ideas a reality... a virtual reality! <br><br>
    This course is an introduction to Virtual Reality programming. No prior coding experience is required!</p>

	<h3>Physics</h3>

	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Physics is the Key!</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong>Physics is the key to understanding the world around us, the world inside us, and the world beyond us. It is the most fundamental science, encompassing the study of the largest galaxies to the smallest subatomic particles! This program will reflect this wide range of applications as we study the physics of motion that allows us to soar through the sky down to the physics of electrons that gives us electricity. Participants will engage in a series of hands-on activities to explore these concepts and come away with a better understanding of the amazing science that governs our world.</p>
