	<h1>EXPLORE TECH</h1>
	<h2>For 7th to 9th grade girls</h2>
        <p>
        This program gives our participants the opportunity to investigate
        specific topics in depth. Participants can choose one or both topics,
        to meet four or eight times per semester on School of Mines campus.
	Registration for our Fall 2017 program is now open.

	<h3>2017 Fall Session</h3>
	<h4>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER Computer Science or Math, or BOTH!</h4>

	<hr>
	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Game Maker Arcade: Coding in Microsoft Touch Develop</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Why simply play video games when you can code them? In this program, participating girls will code their very own game using Microsoft Touch Develop! This versatile language is perfect for a diverse range of student experience as it offers three different skill levels. For example, girls will be able to choose to code using a drag-and-drop method or further challenge themselves by typing the code directly! In this program, participating girls will gain and improve universal coding skills through project-based learning. At the end of the program, participating girls will have their very own game to share with friends and family! Plus, after the program ends, participating girls can continue working on their game or develop new games since Touch Develop can run on any internet-enabled device (even a phone)â€”no installation necessary!</p>

	<p><strong>Course Requirements:</strong> Participating girls need a gmail or outlook email account (including password). This enables girls to save and publish their work, as well as work from any device. The Touch Develop online environment is very safe. There is no private information displayed automatically.</p>

	<p><strong>Course Instructor:</strong> Alex is a Sophomore studying Computer Science at Mines. She has experience in graphic design, web design, and game design. Her interest in STEM was sparked by tech-based projects in high school and she now aims to provide that same experience for the next generation of students.</p>

	<h3>Math</h3>

	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Math in Unexpected Places</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Mathematics is about much more than finding square roots, memorizing the quadratic formula, or proving geometric facts! Throughout the centuries, Mathematics has made many great innovations and breakthroughs possible. It is important in a wide range of fields, including those as diverse as psychology, economics, medicine, linguistics, and history. In this program, participants will learn a variety of nontraditional math topics, such as concealing messages through patterns, learning techniques for solving math riddles and puzzles, recognizing math in art, music, and nature, and discovering the important use of math in many applications, such as those in Computer Science and technology. By the end of this program, the participating girls will have a much broader view of mathematics due to experimenting in areas they have likely never thought about before.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Course Instructors:</strong></p>
	<p>Leah is a Sophomore majoring in Applied Mathematics at Mines. Her math studies have shown her how beautiful and under-appreciated it can be. She has a lot of experience mentoring and working with girls, and is always looking for ways that she can do her part in decreasing the gender gap in the STEM fields. She is looking forward to this program, where she has the opportunity to foster girls' love of Math!</p>

	<p>This is Megan's second semester working with DECTech, and she can't wait to be back as part of the team! Her interest in STEM began at a young age, and she is now in her fourth year at Colorado School of Mines pursuing a degree in Computer Science. An avid singer, actress and member of the swing dance team, she is also passionate about the arts and humanities and enjoys bridging the gap between engineering and creativity. Megan's dream is to one day become a teacher and inspire others about the power and versatility of STEM, and she is happy to be part of a program that does just that.</p>
