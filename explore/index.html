	<h3>2018 Spring Session</h3>
	<h4>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER Computer Science or Engineering Design, or BOTH!</h4>

	<hr>
	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Javascript Graphics: Art and Animation</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> In this class, participating girls will have an introduction to a "real-life" programming language: JavaScript! We will be working primarily with graphics using CodeHS, a web-based programming course that is perfect for beginners and experienced coders alike. Furthermore, CodeHS provides great resources for girls who want to continue building their skills beyond the scope of this course. We will begin with drawing shapes to the screen to make art, then use functions to make drawing easier, and finally learn to animate drawings. This session will start simple and then build as more concepts are learned; by the end of the session, all girls will be creating awesome projects!</p>

	<p><strong>Course Requirements:</strong>Participants enrolling in this course must have an email address to sign up for CodeHS.

	<p><img src="../images/instructors/rachel.png" class="instructor-photo"><strong>Rachel</strong> is a sophomore studying Computer Science at Mines. She had always been interested in computer science but did not pursue it until college, where she absolutely fell in love with programming. She wishes she'd had the same opportunities as this group of girls will to begin coding at a young age. She has always loved teaching, and is so excited to be working with DECTech to pursue this passion.</p>

	<h3>Engineering Design</h3>

	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Computer Aided Design (CAD) with SolidWorks</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Do you want to learn how to draw in 3D (3 dimensions)? Do you want to create a 3D design that is printed on a 3D printer? If yes, this program is for you! SolidWorks CAD software is one of the most popular CAD options in both schools and workplaces. In this program, participants will learn how to draw, design and assemble digital items.  We will learn skills such as precision engineering drawing, critical thinking, and mental 3D visualization. We will also cover how to configure files for 3D printing, laser cutters, and CNC milling machines. By the end of the program, girls will have an in depth understanding of the possibilities of digital design and have an opportunity to pick up their printed design! </p>
