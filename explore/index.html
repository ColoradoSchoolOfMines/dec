	<h2>For 7th and 8th grade girls, Fall 2016</h2>
	<img src="../discover/images/DTBacks.png" style="min-height: 300px; max-width: 85%;">

	<h4>New program offering this fall! Due to the popularity of our young girls’ program, DISCOVER TECH for grades 3-6, we are now offering continued programming for our middle school age group!</h4>

	<h5>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER CS (intro to programming with <i>Scratch</i>), or Physics (studying what we cannot sense), or BOTH!</h5>

	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
		<li>Topics: Computer Science (CS) and Physics </li>
		<li>Time: 5:00-6:15</li>
		<li>Location: Colorado School of Mines campus </li>
		<li>Cost: $60 (4-week session of CS OR Physics)*</li>
		<li>OR $110 (8-week session of CS AND Physics)*</li>
		<li>*Includes a program t-shirt</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Exploration in Computer Science</h2>
	<p>Dip a toe into the world of computer programming with this 4-session course designed for beginners.  Learn how to think like a programmer, solving problems creatively and efficiently using the visual programming language <i>Scratch</i>.  Come ready to think outside the box!</p>

	<h2>Exploration in Physics</h2>
	<p>Many of the greatest discoveries in physics are the discoveries of those things in nature we can’t necessarily see... or hear... or touch! Come with us on a journey into the concept of discovery; how do we study things we cannot necessarily sense?</p>
