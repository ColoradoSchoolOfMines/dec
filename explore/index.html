	<h3>2019 Fall Session</h3>
	<h4>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER Computer Science or Environmental Engineering, or BOTH!</h4>

	<hr>
	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Mobile App Development</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Mobile applications are used everyday for games, media, information, social interaction, and learning. Do you have a great idea for an app but no idea where to get started? This 6-week course will walk participants through the fundamentals of Computer Science, as well as mobile application coding. Students will explore the app development process: ideation, planning, design, app creation, testing, and launch. No experience or devices required!

	<h3>Environmental Engineering</h3>

	<p><strong>Course Title:</strong> Importance and Innovation</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Environmental Engineering is a rapidly expanding field in the age of technology and innovation. Environmental Engineering applies to nearly every aspect of engineering as all human processes can produce detrimental effects on the Earth. Therefore, innovation in this field is essential in helping to ensure that people, plants, animals, and all living organisms remain safe and healthy. We will explore this multidisciplinary field of engineering and participants will complete a multi-week project that could include such things as water treatment processes; microbiology; site remediation, air, water, and soil quality monitoring; and much more! Participants will come away with a better understanding of how environmental engineering is important for the planet as well as how they can make a difference.</p>
