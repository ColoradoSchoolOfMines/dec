                <p>
                This program gives our participants the opportunity to investigate specific topics in depth. Participants can choose one or both offerings, to meet four or eight times per semester on School of Mines campus. **Due to COVID-19 our fall 2020 program will be virtual. See details below.

                <h4>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER Bootstrap:Algebra or Bootstrap:Reactive, or BOTH!</h4>

                <hr>
                <h3>Bootstrap:Algebra</h3>
                <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>none</p>

                <p><strong>Course Description: </strong>In this session, participants will create their very own projects by working with Bootstrap:Algebra, a programming environment combining mathematical concepts with common programming principles. It is perfect for beginners and experienced coders alike! Participants will use the programming language Racket to develop games, graphics, and much more! DECtech instructors will lead small Bootstrap Zoom lessons and participants will apply their knowledge by working through self-guided activities and projects at home. By the end of this 4-week session, participants will design, develop, test, troubleshoot, and present a final visual project.</p>

                <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Bootstrap: Algebra or programming experience with a text-based language</p>
                
                 <p><strong>Course Description: </strong>In this session, participants will build off concepts from Bootstrap:Algebra while exploring new ideas like data structures and conditional logic. DECtech instructors will lead small Bootstrap Zoom lessons and participants will apply their knowledge by working through self-guided activities and projects at home. We will be learning and using a programming language called Pyret to develop animations. By the end of our 4-week session, participants will design, develop, test, troubleshoot and present a re-creation of a classic video game!</p>

                        Hello, I'm <strong>Grace!</strong> I'm originally from Austin, and in my free time you can find me backpacking, reading, or hopefully swimming in a lake. I'm a junior, and this is my third semester working with DECtech. I'm a Computer Science major, and I love teaching and being around kids. I've previously helped with a Robotics course and an app development course for DECtech. I also helped with a ton of virtual STEM camps we held over the summer!<br><br>
