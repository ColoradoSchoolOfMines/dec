                <h3>2020 Spring Session</h3>
                <h4>Girls can join us for exploration in EITHER Computer Science or Environmental Engineering, or BOTH!</h4>

                <hr>
                <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                <p><strong>Course Title: </strong>Robotics</p>

                <p><strong>Course Description: </strong>Robotics technology impacts almost every aspect of our lives. From homes and cars to hospitals and factories, our world today has been transformed by robots. As more advanced technology continues to be developed, it's valuable to understand how they work. We will introduce robotics through a multi-week program that will lead participants through the building and programming of mBots, with exciting activities each week! No programming experience is necessary.</p>

                <h3>Environmental Engineering</h3>

                <p><strong>Course Title:</strong>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</p>

                <p><strong>Course Description:</strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are computer systems used for capturing, storing, verifying, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface. GIS has thousands of applications, from city planning, to looking at animal migratory patterns, to studying glacial movement and retreat in the North Pole. Most people have probably used Google Maps at some point to get from one place to another; this would not be possible without GIS! In this session we will learn more about this extremely powerful field and its endless applications. Using various GIS mapping software, such as ArcMap, we will apply our knowledge and creativity to develop informational maps to display data about a topic of our choosing!</p>
