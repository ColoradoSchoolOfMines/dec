	<h1>EXPLORE TECH</h1>
	<h2>For 7th to 9th grade girls</h2>
        <p>
        This program gives our participants the opportunity to investigate
        specific topics in depth. Participants can choose one or both topics,
        to meet four or eight times per semester on School of Mines campus.
	Registration for our Fall 2017 program will open in August.

		<li>Time: 5:00-6:15</li>
		<li>Location: Colorado School of Mines campus</li>
		<li>Cost: $60 (4-week session of Robotics OR Environmental Geoscience)*</li>
		<li>OR $110 (8-week session of Robotics AND Environmental Geoscience)*</li>
		<li>*Includes a program t-shirt</li>

	<h2>Exploration in Robotics</h2>
        <p>Robots are improving our world, from helping the elderly to doing
        our mundane choirs. Come to this session of EXPLORE TECH and learn
        about the mBot and its exciting features (including sound and obstacle
        avoidance). Participants will engage in the entire engineering design
        process, beginning with building the robot, programming the mBot to
        complete specific challenges, and testing their designs.</p>

	<h2>Exploration in Environmental Geoscience</h2>
        <p>Earth. It’s a pretty neat place to live, but have you ever stopped
        to think about it? How come Earth has a climate, various geologic
        formations, and natural disasters? How do we understand Earth’s history
        when humans have only been around for a fraction of the time? How do we
        use the information we gather? Come to this session of EXPLORE TECH and
        discover the answers to these questions… after all, you do live
        here!</p>
