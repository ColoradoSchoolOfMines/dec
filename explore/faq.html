<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What happens after I register?</strong>
<br><br>A: We will be in contact with you after the registration deadline with more logistical information such as session placement and classroom location. There is a high probability that your daughter will be placed in her first session choice; thus, once you register, mark your calendar!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: If it is after the registration deadline, and I would still like to register, what should I do?</strong>
<br><br>A: Please complete the registration form, and then send email to <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> so that we can immediately find placement for your daughter.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What is the course content?</strong>
<br><br>A: <strong>Course content changes with each semester.</strong>
Topics for Fall 2016 are:
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Computer Science</h4>
This 4-session course is designed for beginners. Learn how to think like a programmer, solving problems creatively and efficiently using the visual programming language <i>Scratch</i>. Come ready to think outside the box!
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Physics</h4>
Participants explore the concept of discovery; how do we study things we cannot necessarily sense?</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: How do I pay for camp?</strong>
<br><br>A: The preferred method of payment is by credit card. After you submit your registration form, you will be prompted to visit this site to complete payment: <a href="http://stemtech.csmspace.com/" target="_blank">http://stemtech.csmspace.com</a>.

<p><strong>Q: How do I drop off/pick up my daughter?</strong>
<br><br>A: Directions to Mines campus are available <a href="http://www.mines.edu/MapsDirectionsParkingInfo" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<br>A map of the campus is <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/facilities/MinesCampusMap.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>Brown is #10 on the map (at the Maple and 17th Street intersection). You will drop off (and pick-up) your daughter near Brown Building. 
The drop off area will be across from where Maple meets 17th, at the curb painted red. See these maps for an illustration.

<p><strong>Q: Am I allowed to sit in on the classes?</strong>
<br><br>A: Often the rooms we use will not have space for parents to sit in. If you feel sitting in would help your daughter be more comfortable, then email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> and we will try to make arrangements. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What if my daughter is sick and misses a class?</strong>

Send email to <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a>  to request a make-up day. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: If I know ahead of time that my daughter will miss a day, should I let someone know?</strong>
<br><br>A: If you are able to do a make-up on another day that week, then email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> and request a make-up day. (See previous question/answer for more details.)</p> 

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Can my daughter be placed with her friend from school?</strong>
<br><br>A: We make every effort to honor these requests.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Who are the EXPLORING TECH teachers and how are they chosen?</strong>
<br><br>A: All EXPLORING TECH teachers are current Mines female students who love engaging the next generation in science and engineering projects. They are chosen through an application/interview process, and then hired after a background check is done. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What is the teacher/child ratio?</strong>
<br><br>A: Each class will have either up to 15 students (with 2 teachers) or up to 20 students (with 3 teachers). </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: My daughter has medical issues. Can she still participate?</strong> 
<br><br>A: Please email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> with details. We are happy to work with you and make appropriate accommodations. </p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: How will I be notified if a class is cancelled due to weather?</strong>
<br><br>A: As long as Mines does not cancel class, the class will not be canceled. If Mines closes, email will be sent to all parents.</p> 

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: When are the program t-shirts distributed?</strong>
<br><br>A: One participant t-shirt is included in the program fee and will be distributed the first day of class. If your child misses class or registers late, contact <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> to arrange for pick up.
