                <p><strong>Q: How do I apply for a scholarship?</strong>
                <br><br>A: Thanks to several companies that partner with the CS Department at Mines, we are able to offer funding for those on the free/reduced lunch program. If budget allows, we will also provide scholarships to other girls with financial need. In order to apply for a scholarship, send email to  <a href="mailto:lmaddux@mines.edu">lmaddux@mines.edu</a> including the following information::
                <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>Child's Name</li>
                    <li>Child's Grade</li>
                    <li>Child's School</li>

                    <li>Scan or photo of free/reduced lunch acceptance letter</li>
                    <li>If NOT on free/reduced lunch program, short description of demonstrated need (e.g. unemployment, single parent, extenuating circumstances)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Q: How do I drop off/pick up my daughter?</strong>
                <br><br>A:
                <strong>New in Fall 2017:</strong> drop-off and pick-up will be on the North end of the CT parking lot. This lot is located on the North side of 18th, between Cheyenne and Arapahoe Streets. Parents/guardians may pull through at the curb (do not park at the curb) on the North end of the lot and drop children off, or park in the CT lot, briefly, and walk to the drop off point. Participants will be marked "present" on the attendance roster and given a name tag by Program staff.
                <br><br>
                At 4:55pm, Program staff will walk participants to the classroom, and the session will begin. After the session is over, Program staff will walk participants back to the drop-off/pick-up area and supervise participant departure between 6:15 - 6:30pm. Parents may pull through at the curb (do not park here), or park in the CT lot (parking is free after 5pm) and walk to the drop-off/pick-up point to retrieve child(ren). Participants "high five" their instructor as they leave.

                <p><strong>Q: Am I allowed to sit in on the classes?</strong>
                <br><br>A: Often the rooms we use will not have space for parents to sit in. If you feel sitting in would help your daughter be more comfortable, then email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> and we will try to make arrangements. </p>

                <hr>
                <p><strong>Q: What if my daughter is sick and misses a class?</strong>
                <br><br>A: We cover the same content in different sessions all week; if space exists, your daughter is welcome to do a make-up class that week (e.g., normally she attends on Tuesdays, but will attend on Wednesday this week). Send email to <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a>  to request a make-up day. </p>

                <hr>
                <p><strong>Q: If I know ahead of time that my daughter will miss a day, should I let someone know?</strong>
                <br><br>A: If you are able to do a make-up on another day that week, then email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> and request a make-up day. (See previous question/answer for more details.)</p>

                <hr>
                <p><strong>Q: Can my daughter be placed with her friend from school?</strong>

                <p><strong>Q: Who are the EXPLORING TECH teachers and how are they chosen?</strong>
                <br><br>A: All EXPLORING TECH teachers are current Mines female students who love engaging the next generation in science and engineering projects. They are chosen through an application/interview process, and then hired after a background check is done. </p>

                <hr>
                <p><strong>Q: What is the teacher/child ratio?</strong>
                <br><br>A: Each class will have either up to 15 students (with 2 teachers) or up to 20 students (with 3 teachers). </p>

                <hr>
                <p><strong>Q: My daughter has medical issues. Can she still participate?</strong>
                <br><br>A: Please email <a href="mailto:stem-tech@mines.edu">stem-tech@mines.edu</a> with details. We are happy to work with you and make appropriate accommodations. </p>

                <hr>
                <p><strong>Q: How will I be notified if a class is cancelled due to weather?</strong>
                <br><br>A: As long as Mines does not cancel class, the class will not be canceled. If Mines closes, email will be sent to all parents.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: When are the program t-shirts distributed?</strong>
                <br><br>A: One participant t-shirt is included in the program fee and will be distributed the first day of class.
