          <h2>Fall 2017</h2>
  <i>I enjoyed this program because it felt more like a team and less like a class, and we were able to move at our own pace to do our own things.
    I liked the quick pace. and the environment with other girls with my interests
  </i>

              <h2>Spring 2017</h2>
  <i>Having people who go to Mines and are experienced in robotics or computer science is really helpful, and it makes me want to go into those kinds of fields even more. </i>

    <h2>Fall 2016</h2>
  <i>One thing I really loved was that the teachers made me feel really
    welcome, and I was never uncomfortable talking to any of them. They were
    all very patient and considerate of my questions and just chatting to me.
    Something else I enjoyed was the good balance of reviewing as a class and
    using our own imagination to create fun stories or games.</i>
