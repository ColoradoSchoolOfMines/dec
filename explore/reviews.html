 <h2>Spring 2018</h2>

  <em>I loved how we played Kahoot! games at the beginning of class and had fun while we learned. I also liked how we had lots of things to work on, so if we finished early we could always move on to something else.
  </em>

      <em>I really liked the program that was used. It was much more advanced than the things I used in the past and I really enjoyed it.

      <em>We think it's wonderful that you offer this and the commitment the students make to teach. Our daughter definitely enjoys each session and comes home each time with another bit of knowledge. Thanks!

      <em>Please keep offering things like this. So many middle school and high school girls shy away from STEM, and I'm sure it will take years to reverse the trend, but opportunities like this have kept my daughter believing her future is in the computer sciences.

         <br> <h2>Fall 2017</h2>
  <em>I enjoyed this program because it felt more like a team and less like a class, and we were able to move at our own pace to do our own things.
    I liked the quick pace. and the environment with other girls with my interests

  <em>Having people who go to Mines and are experienced in robotics or computer science is really helpful, and it makes me want to go into those kinds of fields even more. </em>

    <h2>Fall 2016</h2>
  <em>One thing I really loved was that the teachers made me feel really
    welcome, and I was never uncomfortable talking to any of them. They were
    all very patient and considerate of my questions and just chatting to me.
    Something else I enjoyed was the good balance of reviewing as a class and
    using our own imagination to create fun stories or games.</em>
