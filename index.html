	<h3>Good News:</h3> 
	<p>Studies of informal learning environments suggest that structured,
	non-school science programs can increase children's interest in science and ultimately
	impact the choices these children make in continuing their STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
	education and career choice.</p>
	<h3>Bad News:</h3> 
	<p>Data shows females have less of an interest in most STEM fields than their male peers.</p>
	<h3>Goal: Get more girls interested in STEM!</h3>
